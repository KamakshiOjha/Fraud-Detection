# Credit card Fraud detection using Logistic regression

In this Python-based credit card fraud detection project, logistic regression is applied as a fundamental yet effective machine learning model to assess and predict the likelihood of fraudulent credit card transactions. The project emphasizes simplicity and clarity, serving as an introductory example that highlights the accuracy of the logistic regression model in discerning between genuine and fraudulent activities. Through the utilization of historical credit card transaction data, the logistic regression model undergoes training to understand patterns indicative of fraudulent behavior. The project showcases the model's accuracy in making predictions, demonstrating its reliability in identifying potential fraud.
